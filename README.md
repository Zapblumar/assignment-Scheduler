## assignment Scheduler


## Getting Started

My scheduler
 https://zapblumar.github.io/assignment-Scheduler/.

### Prerequisites


```
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours.
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event.
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage.
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist.
```


## Running the tests

I made sure that the time slots changed colors at the right times and got the clock to always update the time.
